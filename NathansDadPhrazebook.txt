Nathan's Dad gets home from work and asks himself the question...the same question he asks every day. He slowly looks up at the fridge.
Nathan's Dad rubs his sunken eyes, the sterile light from the fridge reflected in his inky pupils.
Nathan's Dad pulls the gallon-sized plastic ziploc from the meat drawer and drains off his sinkwater marinade.
Nathan's Dad is snapped out of it by the clicking of the stove igniter. The flame is lit, and has singed his favorite tie. He blinks away the trails of his brown study. Somehow, he knows Nathan is to blame for this.
Nathan's Dad's sullen expression reflects in the boiling taco meat water. Would this be the day? The day he snapped? He lowered the heat. They would be home any minute. Today could be the day.
